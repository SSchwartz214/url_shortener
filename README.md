### Url Shortener

#### Description

Url Shortner is the backend of an app that allows users to input a url and have it shortened to a custom url.  Users can also visit the original url by clicking on the shortened url as well as view the top 100 most viewed urls.

### Algorithm 
My method "generate_short" takes the database id for a url and converts it into itâ€™s Base 36 equivalent.  Since every url has a unique id no url will ever have the same Base 36 equivalent and as a result will never have the same shortened url.

#### Rails version: 5.1.6
